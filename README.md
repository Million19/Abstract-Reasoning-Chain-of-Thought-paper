### **About the Paper**

Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual pattern recognition but exhibit critical failures in novel abstract reasoning tasks. This failure stems from two fundamental weaknesses: a **Perception Bottleneck** in processing raw spatial data and a **Generalization Bottleneck** in inferring underlying principles.

This paper introduces the **Abstract Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (AR-CoT)**, a formalized neuro-symbolic cognitive architecture that transforms the LLM from a passive pattern-matcher into a deliberate problem-solver. The architecture first uses a deterministic symbolic engine to translate ambiguous visual grids into a structured, LLM-native textual representation of facts. The LLM then executes a formalized cognitive workflow that mandates proactive metacognition and forced principle induction to infer a puzzle's universal rule.

By systematically injecting symbolic grounding and critical self-awareness into the reasoning process, AR-CoT establishes a robust and generalizable blueprint for solving previously intractable abstract problems, marking a significant step toward more general and reliable artificial intelligence.

### **Key Contributions**

*   A novel, end-to-end **neuro-symbolic cognitive architecture** that holistically integrates a deterministic symbolic front-end with a structured neural reasoning back-end.
*   A novel method for solving the **Perception Bottleneck** by translating visual grids into a symbolic `R#,C#` representation with a canonical textual layout.
*   **Advanced Geometric Priming (AGP)**, a novel, two-tiered prompting curriculum that teaches an LLM a symbolic geometric vocabulary.
*   **Misleading Entity Recognition (MER)**, a novel, proactive metacognitive framework for identifying cognitive traps *before* reasoning begins.
*   **Governing Dynamics Abstraction (GDA)**, a novel methodology for coercing a generalist LLM to perform Principle Induction.



### **About the Author**  

Michael Alamin is an independent AI researcher who studied Computer Science at the University of Skövde (Högskolan i Skövde), Sweden. His work focuses on developing robust, principled systems to solve complex, high-impact challenges.


His research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and the physical world, specifically in how AI can be leveraged to design and engineer novel hardware systems. This focus is informed by his practical experience in invention; in 2025, he was awarded the SKAPA Prize (SKAPA-priset), Sweden's largest and most prestigious innovation award. The SKAPA Foundation, established in memory of Alfred Nobel, recognized his development of a groundbreaking hardware and software system—a self-heating, autonomous biodigester.


His work in the AI space is focused on building the practical frameworks necessary to make LLMs reliable. He is the founder of llm_to_mcp_integration_engine, a novel communication framework designed to ensure robust and safe LLM tool execution. This paper on the AR-CoT architecture extends this theme, proposing a cognitive architecture that instills a verifiable, structured reasoning process in LLMs. Both projects are foundational steps toward his long-term goal of applying these principles to generative AI for 3D design and automated hardware development.
